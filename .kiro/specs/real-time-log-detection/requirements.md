# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds real-time log autodetection and decoding capabilities to ThreatLens, enabling the system to continuously monitor log sources, automatically detect new log entries, and decode them in real-time without manual intervention. This proactive approach will significantly improve the system's ability to identify and respond to security threats as they occur.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a security analyst, I want the system to automatically monitor log sources in real-time, so that I don't have to manually check for new security events.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is running THEN it SHALL continuously monitor configured log sources for new entries
2. WHEN new log entries are detected THEN the system SHALL automatically process them through the ingestion pipeline
3. WHEN monitoring multiple sources THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent log streams without data loss
4. WHEN a log source becomes unavailable THEN the system SHALL retry connection and log the failure

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a security analyst, I want the system to automatically decode and analyze new logs, so that security threats are identified immediately without delay.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new logs are detected THEN the system SHALL automatically parse and validate them
2. WHEN logs are parsed THEN the system SHALL run AI analysis to determine threat severity
3. WHEN analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL store results in the database
4. WHEN high-severity events are detected THEN the system SHALL trigger immediate notifications

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to configure which log sources to monitor, so that I can control what the system watches for security events.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the system THEN I SHALL be able to specify log file paths to monitor
2. WHEN configuring the system THEN I SHALL be able to set monitoring intervals and polling frequencies
3. WHEN configuring the system THEN I SHALL be able to enable/disable specific log sources
4. WHEN configuration changes are made THEN the system SHALL apply them without requiring a restart

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a security analyst, I want to see real-time updates of detected events in the dashboard, so that I can respond immediately to security threats.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new events are processed THEN the dashboard SHALL update automatically without page refresh
2. WHEN events are displayed THEN they SHALL show real-time timestamps and processing status
3. WHEN multiple events occur simultaneously THEN the dashboard SHALL handle updates efficiently
4. WHEN the dashboard is not active THEN the system SHALL queue updates for when it becomes active

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a security analyst, I want to receive notifications for high-priority events, so that I can take immediate action on critical security threats.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN high-severity events are detected THEN the system SHALL send immediate notifications
2. WHEN notifications are sent THEN they SHALL include event summary and severity level
3. WHEN multiple notification channels are configured THEN the system SHALL use all available channels
4. WHEN notification delivery fails THEN the system SHALL retry and log the failure

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to monitor the health of the real-time detection system, so that I can ensure it's working properly and troubleshoot issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is running THEN it SHALL provide health status indicators for all monitored sources
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for troubleshooting
3. WHEN performance metrics are available THEN the system SHALL track processing rates and latency
4. WHEN system resources are constrained THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle backpressure

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a security analyst, I want the system to handle different log formats automatically, so that I don't need to manually configure parsing for each log type.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN encountering unknown log formats THEN the system SHALL attempt automatic format detection
2. WHEN log formats are detected THEN the system SHALL apply appropriate parsing rules
3. WHEN parsing fails THEN the system SHALL store raw logs and flag them for manual review
4. WHEN new log formats are learned THEN the system SHALL remember them for future use
